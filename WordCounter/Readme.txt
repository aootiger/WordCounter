Instruction about how to use the app:
the app will take input from command line. 
For example:
Use cmd and relocate current directory to the folder of "WordCounter.exe" then enter the following
WordCounter.exe "This is a statement, that is not a statement."
Then press enter, the result will be displaced under the input.

Since the question description didn't mention how user would like to input the statement, 
By default, I use cmd args as input, I designed the app's interface in a way that it is able to implement other function so that it can take input from other sources. For example: file, web.

Thanks for review!
